<div id="big-bold">Director of Strategy & Innovation</div>
<div id="time">[March 2019 - present]</div>
<div id="words">Heading an international team to deliver an ecosystem of tools, products, and services aimed to redesign a researcher’s interactions with all aspects of academia. I was initially responsible for the vision and recruitment, and now for delivery of this extensive project which relies heavily on knowing how researchers and editors work, and how these workflows can be reimagined to the benefit of both parties. Recently I have taken on responsibility for developing programmes around how AI and NLP can evaluate preprint publications and investigating if there is a ‘third way’ between preprint screening and full peer review that allows evaluation and validation of manuscripts to speed up the review process. Additionally, I am also increasingly obsessed with accessibility, the environmental impact of web-based services, and researcher credits/rewards for non-publication activities. I am also fascinated by, but so-far unconvinced about, the benefits of web3/DeSci for researchers.</div>

In addition to product management functions, UX and R&D teams also report in to me, giving us a full-stack product team to deliver innovative, rather than incremental, change to the industry.</div>
