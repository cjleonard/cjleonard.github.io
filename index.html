<h2>Chlorine Publishing Services</h2>


<div id="bold">About us</div>



<div id="words">CPS was founded in 2015 with the express purpose of providing researchers and institutions access to the very best English language editing for peer-reviewed journals. Not only do we edit for language and comprehension, we also suggest more radical structural edits which we know appeal to editors and reviewers. Our speciality is in editing biomedical manuscripts from Arabic-native speakers, but we will happily edit papers in physical, natural, and social sciences from all parts of the world.</div>



<div id="bold">How it works</div>



<div id="small-bold">Step 1</div>
<div id="big-bold">Initial draft edit</div>
<div id="words">The initial draft of the manuscript is submitted to us, along with the name of the target journal. We review the maunscript to make sure it adheres to the requirements for that particular journal, read the manuscript, edit it, and make suggestions to the author on how they could improve its presentation. This whole process usually takes 6-8 hours for an average manuscript (in terms of length of initial level of English).</div>

<div id="small-bold">Step 2</div>
<div id="big-bold">Author revision</div>
<div id="words">Author approves the edits and answers queries from the editing process. In certain cases we may advise a more radical edit involving moving sections around, or even re-writing certain key paragraphs.</div>

<div id="small-bold">Step 3</div>
<div id="big-bold">Edit of revised manuscript</div>
<div id="words">We conduct one final edit of the manuscript to ensure it stands the maximum chance of delighting the editor and entering the peer-review process. It is important to note that we do not comment on the science, so cannot guarentee an article will be accepted for publication. We will advise adherence to research protocols in the editing stage, but we don't comment on the data or theories being proposed.</div>

<div id="small-bold">Step 4</div>
<div id="big-bold">Post-publication promotion</div>
<div id="words">Once the article has been published, we will provide the author with a list of key actions they can undertake to promote their work to their peers and beyond. With the volume of research articles being published nowadays (>2.5 million each year) it is important to make sure your work stands out in the crowd.</div>

<div id="small-bold">Costs</div>
<div id="big-bold">US$55/hour</div>
<div id="words">We operate on an open and transparent business model whereby we charge all customers the same flat fee. Larger customers can request to be invoiced retrosepctively. Smaller customers or individuals can use PayPal. Each mansucript typically takes between 5-10 hours, depending on length, complexity, and the quality of the initial draft.</div>



<div id="bold">Who we are</div>
